# React App Setup Instructions

This README provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the React application. Follow these steps to get started:

---

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher recommended) 
  Download from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn** (optional)

---

## Steps to Set Up the Project

### 1. Create a New React App
1. Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React app:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-react-app
   ```
2. Navigate to the newly created app's directory:
   ```bash
   cd my-react-app
   ```

### 2. Replace Files
1. Replace the default **`public`** and **`src`** folders with the ones provided in this project:
   - Copy the `public` folder from this project and paste it into your app's root directory.
   - Copy the `src` folder from this project and paste it into your app's root directory.

2. Overwrite any existing files if prompted.

### 3. Install Dependencies
1. Copy the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files from this project and replace the ones in your app's root directory.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command will install all the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

---

## Running the Application
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

---

## Notes
- If you encounter any issues, ensure all dependencies are correctly installed by deleting the `node_modules` folder and running:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Modify the code in the `src` folder as per your requirements to customize the app further.

---

## Project Structure
After replacing the files, your project directory should look like this:
```
my-react-app/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── ...
├── src/
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── ...
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── README.md
```

Enjoy building your React app!
